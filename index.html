                <h1>What is cholesterol?</h1></br></br>
                Cholesterol is a waxy substance which is carried by lipoproteins, which makes up various important bodily components such as vitamin D, hormones, and other substances such as those that aid in digestion.

                </br></br></br><h1>Where does it come from?</h1></br></br>
                80% of body's cholesterol comes from the liver, the rest from dietary sources such as meat, poultry, eggs, fish and dairy.
                Plant-derived foods contain no cholesterol.

                </br></br></br><h1>How does it flow?</h1></br></br>
                Cholesterol doesn't travel freely through the bloodstream. Lipoproteins carry the cholesterol to it's destination, instead.

                </br></br></br><h1>The three types of cholesterol</h1></br></br>
                There are three types of lipoproteins:
                
                LDL (Low-density lipoproteins) contain a higher ratio of cholesterol to protein, which is why it is known as the "bad" cholesterol. High LDL levels increase heart disease, stroke, and PAD risk, by aiding in plaque buildup.
                
                HDL (High-density lipoproteins) contain more protein and less cholesterol than LDL, causing it be known as the "good" cholesterol. More of this is better, a lower amount of cholesterol plaque will be able to build up.
                
                VLDL (Very low-density lipoproteins) contain even less protein than LDL. Also associated with plaque buildup.
                
                Triglycerides can increase cholesterol plaque levels in the case of high LDL and low HDL.
                
                Total cholesterol score is the sum of HDL and LDL cholesterol, as well as 20% of triglycerides. Higher score indicates higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease or strokes.

                <h1>Why monitor lipoproteins?</h1></br></br>
                Monitoring lipoproteins helps to determine how much cholesterol is being let into the bloodstream, or back into the liver.

            </div>
            <div class="right" ><h1>What are considered safe levels?</h1></br></br>
            In adults, good cholesterol levels read as such:
            <ul class="right">
                <li>Less than 200 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) for the total cholesterol level</li>
                <li>Less than 100 mg/dL for the LDL cholesterol levels</li>
                <li>For HDL, less than 40 mg/dL is dangerously low, with levels of 60 mg/dL or higher being the optimal level</li>
            </ul>
        </br>
        In children, good cholesterol levels are lower:
        <ul class="right">
            <li>Total cholesterol should be less than 170 mg/dL</li>
            <li>LDL should be less than 110 mg/dL</li>
        </ul>
        Higher than the recommended levels for total cholesterol and LDL levels can be dangerous, and should be looked into. Low HDL levels are also dangerous, and should also be looked into.

            <div class="left">
            </br></br></br><h1>How does diet affect cholesterol levels and overall health?</h1></br></br>
                Due to how various foods (many animal products) can contain different amounts of cholesterol, this excess cholesterol will be absorbed by the body and into the bloodstream, causing levels to fluctuate. Foods high in unsaturated fat can help decrease LDL and increase HDL levels, foods high in saturated fats increase both HDL and LDL levels, increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, and trans fats increase LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol levels, while reducing HDL cholesterol levels.

                </br></br></br><h1>Risk factors</h1></br></br>
                Cholesterol increases as you get older. 
                Genetics, known as familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition where the number of liver receptor cells is low, causing LDL levels to rise, increasing potential for issue.
                Weight, as being overweight being obese increases cholesterol level.
                Certain races can have higher cholesterol, such as African Americans having higher HDL and LDL cholesterol than caucasians.

                </br></br></br><h1>Potential issues</h1></br></br>
                A blood clot caused by plaque build up can block blood flow in coronary arteries, potentially causing chest pain or a heart attack. This plaque buildup occurs when not enough HDL is present, or when there is too much LDL present, and too much cholesterol is travelling through the bloodstream, causing this cholesterol plaque to form. A blood clot in other arteries can cause carotid artery disease, a stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. Decreased blood flow to the brain can also cause a transient ischemic attack, essentially a mini-stroke.

                </br></br></br><h1>Lowering cholesterol</h1></br></br>
                Lifestyle changes such as diet changes, weight management, and regular exercise can help regulate cholesterol.
                There are medications that can lower cholesterol as well, such as statins, which decrease LDL, Niacin, which decreases both LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL, Bile acid resins, which decrease LDL, and Fibric acid derivatives, which lower LDL levels as well.
                
                Those with familial hypercholesterolemia may receive treatment known as lipoprotein apheresis, which uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. It then returns the rest of the blood back to the person.
